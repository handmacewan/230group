With a listening ear and a sympathetic smile, she'd often offer words of encouragement. |Celebrations at the kitchen table were our tradition, spanning birthdays, holidays, and every joyous occasion in between. And at the heart of it all was mom, orchestrating the festivities with her unwavering love and infectious joy.]]
